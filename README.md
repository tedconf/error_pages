# TED Error Pages

This repo is used to maintain the error pages we serve.

## Getting started

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide. It explains how to install Grunt's CLI.

Once you have the Grunt CLI installed, install this project's package dependencies:

	$ npm install

## Builds

Once you're set up, run:

	$ grunt build

...will build output to the /dist folder. Once done, you can simply
copy the files you need from there to the final destination of your
error page.

## Tweaks

Once you're set up, run:

	$ grunt server

...and a browser window should open at http://localhost:9000 where your changes to the error pages will be livereloaded.
